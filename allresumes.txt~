A resume is ¥ a summary of your skills, experiences, achievements and activities; ¥ a marketing tool presented to employers in order to obtain an interview. A good resume is  ¥ succinct, detailed and action-oriented; ¥ organized with easy-to-read headers, identifiable sections and an effective use of white space; ¥ and focuses the reader on the information most relevant to the position applied for. Resume Contents Identification:  Name, address(es), phone number(s), email  ¥ Include both campus and permanent address and phone number if currently at school ¥ Include day/evening/cell phone number if appropriate Tip: Make sure that a professional greeting is recorded on your voicemail! Tip: Make sure that you use a professional email address (i.e., yourname@vassar.edu vs. coolchick@aol.com) ¥ Do not include non-relevant personal information such as your age, sex, marital status, race, religion, national origin, political affiliation, social security number, or health status Objective: The reason you are sending the resume to the employer (optional) ¥ Objectives are not required, but may be useful to focus a resume ¥ Clear, concise and specific to the position applied for  Example: Instead of ÒI am currently seeking any position in a museum where I can use my diverse range of art history skills,Ó use something like ÒTo obtain a teaching position in a natural history museumÓ Education: Institution(s) attended (including JYA), location, degree(s) earned, major(s), minor(s), cumulative GPA, major GPA (obtainable by calculating yourself), correlate, thesis, graduation date ¥ May include key courses relevant to objective ¥ May highlight achievements, such as a high GPA ¥ High school is not necessary to include  3  How to start ! Brainstorm all of your experiences, paid and unpaid. ! Include accomplishments for each ! Include responsibilities ! Include skills needed to meet those responsibilities ! Rank the experiences by importance to the job you seek ! Now you can start to write them out in a more organized format  Experience: Internships, work experience, research experience, volunteer experience, fieldwork, organizational leadership, etc. ¥ Include the following components within this section for each entry: o Position held (title) o Name and location of organization (City, State or Vassar College) o Dates of work o Accomplishments and responsibilities o Demonstrated skills  Tip: Remember to be consistent in your use of date formats; for example, use ONE of the following date styles rather than Òmix and matchÓ: January 20xx-May 20xx, or 1/20xx-5/20xx, or Jan. 20xx-May 20xx, or Spring 20xx  TIPS FOR WRITING THE EXPERIENCE SECTION ¥ Work reverse chronologically within each category starting with your most recent experience. ¥ Describe (rather than list) your accomplishments using Action Words to depict yourself as Òa doer.Ó (A list of action words is included on page 5). Quantify whenever possible, using numbers, percentages and dollars.  ¥ Include transferable skills you gained from each experience; those skills that you build and carry with you as you move from job to job such as oral and written communication, interpersonal skills, working effectively with a team, leadership, and research or analytical skills. ¥ Place those jobs and accomplishments that will be valued most for the job you are seeking prominently on your resume.

I, we, they, us)  Focus on your accomplishments  11  Resume Checklist ! Do you have the resume components listed in an order that highlights your most relevant experience?  !

Create a spreadsheet or centralized record of all action you have taken. This will lessen the guesswork in following up on job prospects, interviews, and offers.  Cover Letters And Other Job Search Correspondence Job search correspondence is  ! designed to generate interviews and, ultimately, job offers  ! written specifically for each application, and not mass produced. Structure Of Correspondence Your letter writing should follow the principles of proper English usage and effective business correspondence. Generally, it is best to use simple and straightforward language in communicating your message. Be direct and concise. Job-search correspondence typically includes the following components: ! WriterÕs return address ! Date ! Employer's name and address (inside address) ! Salutation ! Body (usually 3-4 paragraphs) ! Complimentary closing ! Writer's name and signature ! Enclosure notation (when appropriate)  As when preparing your resume, there are several guidelines to consider when writing job-search correspondence: ! Use standard 8 1/2 x 11-inch paper ! Use good quality stationery (e.g., Òresume paperÓ), preferably the same type used for your resume ! Always type correspondence; handwritten letters are unacceptable in the U.S. (Note, however, that in some parts of the world handwritten letters are preferred).   ! Be sure to proofread and correct all spelling and grammatical mistakes; Letters must be error-free; Do not rely on software spell-checks! ! Use the same font style and size as your resume  27  Remember! Job search correspondence is business correspondence, and should always be typed Types Of Correspondence There are seven basic types of job search correspondence: 1) the cover letter, 2) prospecting letter, 3) interview confirmation letter, 4) post-interview thank you, 5) job offer clarification, 6) letter of acceptance, and 7) letter of declination. While each letter has a specific focus, the format is similar for all. The Cover Letter A letter of application, or cover letter, provides cover for an attachment or an enclosure (your resume). A well-written cover letter allows you to highlight your qualifications in a way that lets the employer know why you are the best candidate for the position To be an effective advertisement introducing the qualities you are promoting in your resume, your letter should: ! capture the reader's attention, ! stress your potential value and benefit, ! invite an in-depth reading of your resume. In general, the basic cover letter has three sections (i.e., paragraphs), each with a specific purpose: Paragraph 1Ð Tell why you are writing. State how you found out about the organization/position; Mention any referrals Paragraph 2Ð Refer to your attached resume. Highlight skills relevant to the organization/position; Indicate how you can make a contribution  Paragraph 3Ð State how and when you plan to follow up. Indicate your interest in meeting to discuss the organization/position; Thank the employer for their time and consideration Although cover letters are not always required for resumes submitted for many on-campus interviews, they should always be used when sending resumes or returning employment applications to hiring officials. Electronic Cover Letters With the increased use of the internet for job search correspondence, you may more often than not email your resume rather than sending a traditional Òhard copy.Ó In this case, you will still want to include a Òcover noteÓ in your email that will serve the same purpose as the more traditional cover letter. The following are a few tips for writing e-cover letters: ! Use the subject line of your email to entice the potential reader. ! Include a statement about who you are, the position you are applying for, how you heard about this job, and an indication of your knowledge of the organization.  ! Adhere to the same guidelines for length of hard copy letters (3 paragraphs in general). ! Use standard salutations and closings (e.g., ÒDearÓ and ÒSincerelyÓ). ! Carefully spell-check and proofread your cover letter.  28 Prospecting Letter ! Use to inquire about possible vacancies, get your resume read, and generate interviews. ! Use extensively for long-distance searches. ! Target specific individuals in specific organizations. ! Structure as you would the basic application letter (cover letter).  ! Focus on how your qualifications match the organization's needs. Post-Interview Thank You Send promptly (within 24 hours) after each of your interviews. A well-written thank-you letter will: ! Remind the employer who you are and impress them with your courtesy and follow-through. ! Reiterate your background and qualifications. ! Show your enthusiasm and continued interest in the field or specific position discussed. ! Convey to the employer your sincere appreciation for his or her time and consideration. Tip: Sending your thank you letter via email is appropriate and strongly encouraged, especially if there is a quick hiring timeline; additionally, you can follow up with a Òhard copy.Ó Traditional letters will remind them of you a few days after the interview has passed. Job Offer Clarification:  Sent in response to an oral or written job offer that does not provide all of the pertinent information you need to make an informed decision.  Your letter should: ! Indicate your interest in the employer and the offer. ! Ask specifically for the information you need. Note: This information may be requested over the telephone, but be certain to confirm all details in writing with the employer to avoid any future misunderstandings. Letter Of Acceptance Sent to formally accept position and clarify important information: ! Refer to the offer made by the employer. ! Restate terms of employment and confirm pre-employment details, starting date, etc. ! Close the letter by expressing your appreciation and pleasure at joining the organization. Letter Of Declination/Withdrawal As a courtesy, a formal letter declining a job should be sent to each employer who extended you an offer after you have made a decision not to accept. You should also notify an employer if you wish to withdraw your candidacy before an offer has been made. Always be tactful and appreciative in your correspondence (in other words, don't burn any bridges behind you, since you may want to work for these employers in the future).   29 Cover Letter Template Your present address City, state and zip code  TodayÕs date  Mr./Mrs./Ms. Name (specific person), Title Company/Organization Name Street Address City, state and zip code  Dear Ms. or Mr. (last name): Opening Paragraph Ð Make an impression! ¥ Identify your source of information (VCLink, Idealist.org, Company Website) or: ¥ Mention a name if someone has referred you, if you have been in contact with an employee at the company, or if you attended an information session ¥ Reference a long-held interest or passion for the field if applicable ¥ Name the position and emphasize the ÒfitÓ between you and the company  Middle Paragraph ÐMake the connection between the job description and your qualifications: ¥ Lead with a strong topic sentence linking your experiences to the position ¥ Indicate the relevant skills you have developed through your academic study, extracurricular activities, internships, and work experiences ¥ Demonstrate how this information strongly qualifies you for the position ¥ DONÕT REPEAT YOUR ENTIRE RESUME! ¥ Make the most of your life experiences!

Samuel Smith provided an excellent presentation on campus this past Thursday evening about the opportunities available at the firm for a soon to be graduate like myself. I returned to my room convinced there could be a working environment as satisfying as my academic experience at Vassar has been.   The corporate culture of My Financial Company is very impressive: teamwork combined with opportunities for contributing independent ideas is just what I am seeking to enhance my education after graduation. As a student, I have worked on campus at the Computing and Information Services department. This experience has allowed me to formulate different strategies that could be used to increase the efficiency of student employees. In my role as a student consultant, we developed a focus group that analyzed performance and efficiency at the helpdesk, the first line of response for campus user services. Our conclusions called for a formalized training program, a project team on which I currently serve as a student leader .  In addition, I have had many opportunities to be involved with campus life, as Vice President of the Vassar Student Association and as a Student Fellow in the residence halls. These have been particularly meaningful experiences for me while enhancing my leadership and communication skills.  My selection as student leader of the year and a certificate of appreciation for exemplary work at the Computing and Information Services department are testaments to my dedication, energy and hard work. I am eager to bring these qualities to My Financial Company.  My resume and college transcript are attached for your review. Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide. I can be reached by phone at 845-222-2222 or by email at mismith3@vassar.edu. Thank you for your consideration.

Serving in this role at Sullivan & Cromwell will engage both my study of literature and passion for law with challenging business objectives.  I have been preparing for a career in law for many years, and have been able to explore some of its facets through summer programs at Cambridge University (international law) and Columbia University (constitutional law). Political science studies at Vassar College have broadened my understanding of the societal context in which our legal system operates, and summer internships at the district attorney!s office in Delaware County, Pennsylvania gave me first-hand experience with how the American legal system functions in its most local form. Summer work at the American Law Institute introduced me to the intricacy of the common law system, enriching my understanding of the incredibly important role of litigation in the formation of American jurisprudence.  The analytical skills and knowledge of legal concepts I have gained as both an English major and a student of our legal system have prepared me for a position with your firm. As a senior at Vassar and a graduate of St. Peter!s School, my education has solidified my passion for and commitment to pointed investigation and careful inquiry. As an engaged student, athlete, editor of Vassar!s student newspaper, and member of a close community, I have significant experience with teamwork and group collaboration. My engagement, ability to work independently and with others, and enthusiastic work ethic will make me an asset to Sullivan & Cromwell.  The attached resume provides additional educational and personal details. My salary requirement is in the $35,000 - $40,000 range (based on my research, and flexible depending on benefits included in the total compensation package). Please feel free to contact me at your convenience by cell (610-389-4195) or email (jajohnson@vassar.edu). I am confident my background, motivation, and desire to share my ideas would be an asset to Sullivan & Cromwell. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
